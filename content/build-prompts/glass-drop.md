# Glass Drop

Add the "Glass Drop" component from Nexus UI to my project.

A logo intro made of liquid glass. A droplet lands as a bubble that magnifies your logo, swells into a rounded glass tile whose thick edges bend the logo and split the light into colour, then clears to your logo at full size. Pick the ending: the logo alone, or the logo with your name, where a second drop lands and opens into a rippling lens that sweeps out over the name until the lockup is crisp. Three looks: dark, light and blue. Drop in any SVG or PNG and it uses that instead of the default mark. Plays when it comes into view and click to replay.

Please:

1. Create the files below at sensible paths for this project, keeping each file's name. They import each other with relative paths, so keep them together.
2. Install what it needs: `framer-motion` (use this project's package manager).
3. It is styled with Tailwind CSS classes, so the project needs Tailwind.
4. Use it like this: `import { GlassDrop } from "@/components/glass-drop";`. The props are typed and documented in the code.

Copy the code exactly as it is. Do not restyle, simplify or rename anything, and keep the comments: they explain why the numbers are what they are. The only thing to adapt is import paths, if this project uses a different alias than `@/`.
